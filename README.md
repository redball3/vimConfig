This is for my personal vim config based heavily off https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/init.lua/

- some things i've removed since they arent relevant to me
- using lazy.nvim instead of packer since packer looks to be no longer maintained

h2. requires vim 0.8+

easy way to install:
```
git clone https://github.com/redball3/vimConfig.git

ln -s ./vimConfig ~/.config/nvim
```
